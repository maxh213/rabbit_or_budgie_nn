# rabbit_or_budgie_nn
A neural network written in python which should be able to tell the difference between a picture of a budgie or rabbit when it's complete

#Acknowledgments
If you own/object to the use of any of the images used by this network please let me know and I'll remove them.

I realise the git repository is a very bad place to keep a lot of training/testing images BUT it was a bit of a pain to find 1000+ images of budgies and rabbits each so they're here until I find a better solution.
